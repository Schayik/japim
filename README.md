# Japim

Japim is an amateur app designed to show some interesting and funny stats between players, such as Kill Steal Score. A user enters up to 5 summoner names and the app will calculate the kill steal score for all matches (last 100 for now) played together (same team).

The app originates from the Dorans newspaper (Dorans is a LoL student association in Nijmegen, the Netherlands) which shows various stats between its members. Me and a friend had an idea to automise this and thus started working on Japim. Our app is very basic at the moment, but weâ€™re planning to add features along the way.

## Getting Started

This app consist of a django server and a react client. First, [run the django server](https://github.com/Schayik/japim/tree/master/django_server) and then [start the react client](https://github.com/Schayik/japim/tree/master/react_client).
